Your response goes here!

* I have learned how <div> works and how to properly organize html tags. I'm also aware of good practices and got a solid understanding of the html tree structure.
* It was easy to understand how html structures works and how the web works.
* I had a hard time memorizing the head properties and how the <figure> works. I also had a hard time researching how to do the superscript citation in the end of the article, since I had no clue about the term "superscript".
* I researched on mozilla and other websites to solve my issues.
